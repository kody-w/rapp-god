"""Mars Barn Opus — Communication Delay

Earth-Mars communication with realistic light-speed delay.
Commands from the operator arrive delayed. The colony must survive
autonomously during the gap. This is the core tension of real
Mars operations.

Light delay: 4-24 minutes one-way depending on orbital position.
Round-trip: 8-48 minutes. At opposition (closest): ~4 min.
At conjunction (farthest, behind the Sun): ~24 min.
During solar conjunction: total blackout for ~2 weeks.

In the simulation, delay is measured in sols (not minutes) for
playability, but the principle is the same: the operator cannot
react in real time. The colony lives or dies on its own decisions.
