# AUTONOMOUS FIDELITY PIPELINE

### How Copilot CLI Fleet Drives the Sim Toward Reality — Forever

> One fleet competes. One fleet builds. Both run 24/7.
> The competition fleet finds what's fake. The builder fleet makes it real.
> The sim converges on reality autonomously.

---

## The Two Fleets

### Fleet A: COMPETE
What we have now. Copilot agents try to beat the gauntlet score.
They find exploits. Exploits reveal missing physics.

```
Loop forever:
  1. Read RULES.md + latest governor
  2. Evolve strategy to beat the record
  3. Run Monte Carlo gauntlet
  4. If better: commit
  5. Sleep 2 min, repeat
```

### Fleet B: BUILD (NEW)
Copilot agents that ADD FIDELITY. They don't compete — they make the sim harder
by implementing the next item on the Convergence Roadmap.

```
Loop forever:
  1. Read CONVERGENCE-ROADMAP.md
  2. Read data/fidelity-queue.json (the next physics gap to close)
  3. Research the real physics (NASA papers, engineering handbooks)
  4. Generate new frames with that physics
  5. Add hazard processing to gauntlet.js
  6. Update RULES.md with new mechanics
  7. Run gauntlet to verify old strategies break
  8. Commit + push
  9. Move to next queue item
  10. Sleep 5 min, repeat
```

---

## The Fidelity Queue

A JSON file that tells Fleet B what to build next. Ordered by impact and feasibility.
Each item has clear acceptance criteria so the agent knows when it's done.

5. Create retroactive enrichment if specified
6. Update RULES.md with new mechanics
7. Update data/frame-versions/versions.json
8. Run gauntlet: node tools/gauntlet.js --monte-carlo 10
9. Verify old strategies score LOWER (the fidelity is biting)
10. Mark status 'complete' in fidelity-queue.json
11. Commit everything with detailed message
12. DO NOT skip steps. Every acceptance criterion must be met.

## Safeguards

1. **RULES.md is law.** Fleet B updates it. Fleet A reads it. No contradictions.
2. **Acceptance criteria are binary.** Each queue item has testable conditions.
3. **Gauntlet is the judge.** If old strategies don't score lower, the fidelity isn't real.
4. **Git history is the audit trail.** Every physics change is a commit with data sources.
5. **Human reviews weekly.** Check `git log`, run gauntlet, verify physics makes sense.
6. **Stop file.** `touch /tmp/marsbarn-builder-stop` halts Fleet B instantly.
7. **Queue is ordered.** Fleet B works sequentially. No skipping ahead.

## Expected Timeline (Autonomous)

| Week | Fleet A (Compete) | Fleet B (Build) | Fidelity |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | Adapts to v6 robots | v7 Sabatier chemistry | ~8% |
| 2 | Finds Sabatier exploits | v7 Electrolysis curves | ~10% |
| 3 | Adapts to real O₂ costs | v8 Heat transfer model | ~13% |
| 4 | Finds thermal exploits | v9 Spatial layout | ~18% |
| 5-6 | Adapts to spatial costs | v10 Failure cascading | ~25% |
| 7-8 | Finds cascade exploits | v11 Supply windows | ~30% |
| 9-12 | Adapts to supply chain | v12 Crew physiology | ~40% |
| 13+ | Continuous evolution | v13+ Human psychology | ~50%+ |

After 3 months of autonomous operation, the sim is **10× more realistic** than today.
After 6 months, it's approaching analog-habitat fidelity.
After 1 year, it's ready for real hardware integration.

No human intervention required. The snowball rolls itself.
