## Troubleshooting

### Extension disappeared after browser restart

**Solution:** The extension folder was moved or deleted. Chrome needs continuous access to the unpacked files.

- Extract to a permanent location (Documents folder recommended)
- Do NOT delete the folder after installation
- If you need to move it, remove the extension first, then reinstall

### "This extension may have been corrupted" error

**Solution:**

1. Remove the extension
2. Re-extract the ZIP file to a new location
3. Ensure you're not using a network drive or cloud-synced folder
4. Load the extension again

### Can't find "Load unpacked" button

**Solution:** Developer mode must be enabled. Toggle the switch in the top-right corner of the extensions page.

### Apps showing 404 errors

**Solution:** Incorrect folder structure selected.

1. Select the folder containing `manifest.json` (not a parent folder)
2. Verify the `apps/` and `data/` folders exist inside
3. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
