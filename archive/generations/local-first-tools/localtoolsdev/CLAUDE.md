# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

localFirstTools is a collection of self-contained HTML applications. Each HTML file is a complete application with inline CSS and JavaScript and no build step — open it in any browser and it just runs. The project includes 100+ interactive tools, games, and creative applications discoverable through a gallery launcher.

The "local-first" name describes the *philosophy* (your data stays in your browser; the app keeps working when you're offline), not a religion about dependencies. **CDNs are completely fine.** Plenty of apps in this repo pull Three.js, PeerJS, qrcodejs, WebLLM, Yjs, sql.js, HTMX, etc. from CDNs because there's no practical inline alternative — and that's exactly what CDNs are for.

## Key Architecture Principles

1. **Self-Contained HTML Files**: Every application is a single HTML file with its CSS and JavaScript inline. Don't split an app into separate `.css` / `.js` companion files; keep it as one shippable artifact.
2. **External Libraries via CDN are Welcome**: When a library makes the app dramatically better (Three.js for 3D, PeerJS for P2P, sql.js for embedded SQLite, WebLLM for in-browser AI, etc.), pull it from a CDN. No npm, no bundlers, no build step.
3. **Gallery System**: The root `index.html` is a launcher that reads `vibe_gallery_config.json` for application discovery and metadata.
4. **Auto-Discovery**: Python scripts (`vibe_gallery_updater.py` and friends) scan HTML files and extract metadata.
5. **Local Persistence**: Apps store user data in `localStorage` / IndexedDB / OPFS. Every app should expose a JSON import/export so users can move state between devices.

## Commands

### Update Gallery Configuration
```bash
# Primary method - extracts metadata and regenerates config
python3 vibe_gallery_updater.py
# (Symlinked from scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_updater.py)

# Watch mode - automatically updates when HTML files change
python3 scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_watcher.py

# Run watcher once and exit (quick update)
python3 scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_watcher.py --once

# Quick shell wrapper (runs updater)
./update-gallery.sh
# (Symlinked from scripts/shell/update-gallery.sh)

# Legacy updater (still works with data/config/utility_apps_config.json)
python3 archive/app-store-updater.py
```

### Organize Files into Category Folders
```bash
# Move HTML files from root to category folders
python3 scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_organizer.py

# Preview what would be moved (dry run)
python3 scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_organizer.py --dry-run
```

### Update Tools Manifest
```bash
python3 update-tools-manifest.py
# (Symlinked from scripts/gallery/update-tools-manifest.py)
```

### Accessibility Tools
```bash
# Check color contrast in HTML files
python3 scripts/maintenance/color_contrast_check.py

# Apply accessibility patches to HTML files
python3 scripts/maintenance/accessibility_patch.py
```

### Build Xbox Extension
```bash
cd edgeAddons/xbox-mkb-extension
./create-xbox-mkb-extension.sh
```

### Run Local Server
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

## Application Categories

The gallery organizes applications into thematic categories:
- **visual_art** - Interactive visual experiences and design tools
- **3d_immersive** - Three-dimensional and WebGL experiences
- **audio_music** - Sound synthesis and music creation tools
- **games_puzzles** - Interactive games and playful experiences
- **experimental_ai** - AI-powered interfaces and cutting-edge demos
- **creative_tools** - Productivity and creative utilities
- **generative_art** - Algorithmic art generation systems
- **particle_physics** - Physics simulations and particle systems
- **educational_tools** - Learning resources and tutorials

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Application
1. Create self-contained HTML file in root directory
2. Include proper `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags
3. Test the application in multiple browsers
4. Run `python3 vibe_gallery_updater.py` to regenerate configs
5. Verify the app appears correctly in index.html gallery

### Development Mode
For active development, use the watcher to automatically update configs:
```bash
python3 vibe_gallery_watcher.py
```
This watches for file changes and automatically regenerates the gallery config.

### Modifying Existing Applications
1. Edit the HTML file directly
2. Test changes in browser
3. Run updater or watcher to update gallery configs
4. Commit changes to git

## Development Guidelines

1. **HTML Structure**: Each application should be a complete, valid HTML document with proper DOCTYPE and meta tags
2. **Responsive Design**: Applications should work on desktop and mobile devices
3. **Local Storage**: Use browser localStorage for persistence, never external databases
4. **Data Import/Export**: Every application should include JSON import/export functionality for data portability
5. **Error Handling**: Applications should gracefully handle offline scenarios and missing data
6. **Performance**: Keep file sizes reasonable since all code is inline
7. **Metadata Tags**: Include descriptive comments in HTML for auto-categorization (e.g., <!-- 3d, canvas, animation -->)
8. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast ratios (use accessibility_patch.py)

## Testing

Testing is done manually in the browser. When modifying applications:
1. Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Test offline functionality
3. Test on mobile devices
4. Verify local storage persistence
5. Test JSON import/export functionality

### Important Files
- **index.html**: Main gallery launcher with 3D gallery mode and Xbox controller support (must remain in root)
- **vibe_gallery_config.json**: Primary application registry with metadata (auto-generated)
- **scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_updater.py**: Main script for updating gallery configuration (symlinked to root)
- **scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_watcher.py**: Auto-updates config when HTML files change
- **scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_organizer.py**: Moves HTML files into category folders
- **tools-manifest.json**: Simple manifest of all HTML tools
- **data/config/utility_apps_config.json**: Legacy registry (still functional)

### Documentation Organization
All documentation has been organized into `docs/` subdirectories:
- **docs/wowmon/**: 60+ WowMon game design documents (endgame, narrative, casual player advocacy, etc.)
- **docs/agent/**: 12 agent strategy and design reports
- **docs/accessibility/**: 6 accessibility guides, reports, and code examples
- **docs/architecture/**: System architecture and design documentation
- **docs/implementation/**: Implementation guides and integration documentation
- **docs/game-design/**: Game redesigns (roguelike, metroidvania, action RPG, etc.)
- **docs/tutorials/**: Quick references, tutorials, and quickstart guides
- **docs/reports/**: Performance reports, optimization recommendations, and analysis
- **docs/misc/**: Other documentation (UIRenderer docs, build ideas, etc.)

### Script Organization
All scripts have been organized into `scripts/` subdirectories:
- **scripts/gallery/**: Gallery maintenance and configuration scripts
- **scripts/maintenance/**: Accessibility, compression, and utility scripts
- **scripts/shell/**: Shell wrapper scripts

### Backward Compatibility
Symlinks in the root directory maintain compatibility with existing workflows:
- `vibe_gallery_updater.py` → `scripts/gallery/vibe_gallery_updater.py`
- `update-tools-manifest.py` → `scripts/gallery/update-tools-manifest.py`
- `update-gallery.sh` → `scripts/shell/update-gallery.sh`

This means existing commands continue to work exactly as before.

## File Naming Conventions

- Application files: `descriptive-name.html` (lowercase with hyphens)
- Configuration files: `*_config.json`
- Shell scripts: `purpose-description.sh`
- Python scripts: `purpose_description.py`

## Metadata Extraction System

The vibe_gallery_updater.py script automatically extracts metadata from HTML files:

### Extracted Metadata
- **Title**: From `<title>` tags or filename
- **Description**: From meta description tag or auto-generated
- **Tags**: Technical features detected (3D, canvas, SVG, animation, etc.)
- **Complexity**: simple/intermediate/advanced (based on file size and features)
- **Interaction Type**: game/drawing/visual/interactive/audio/interface
- **Category**: Auto-assigned based on content analysis

### Auto-Categorization Logic
Applications are automatically categorized into one of 9 categories based on:
1. **Keywords in file path** (e.g., "games", "ai", "media")
2. **Technical features detected** (e.g., WebGL → 3d_immersive)
3. **Content analysis** (e.g., "particle" keyword → particle_physics)
4. **Interaction patterns** (e.g., click/drag/touch → interactive)

### Configuration Files
- **vibe_gallery_config.json** (root): Primary config with full metadata and categorization
- **tools-manifest.json** (root): Simple listing of all HTML files with basic metadata
- **data/config/utility_apps_config.json**: Legacy config (still functional)

When you modify HTML files, run the updater to regenerate these configs automatically.
