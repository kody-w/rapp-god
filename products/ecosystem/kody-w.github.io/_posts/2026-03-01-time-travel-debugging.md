Your system broke at 3 AM. By the time you see it at 9 AM, the evidence is gone. Logs rotated. State overwritten. Memory freed. You're debugging a ghost.

But what if every state change was a commit?

**Time-travel debugging** means your entire system state is version-controlled. Not just your code — your *data*. Every tick, every mutation, every state transition gets committed. When something breaks, you don't grep logs. You `git bisect`.

```bash
git log --oneline state/
# a1b2c3d tick 847: nominal
# e4f5g6h tick 846: nominal
# i7j8k9l tick 845: CRITICAL <-- something happened here
git diff i7j8k9l~1 i7j8k9l -- state/
```

You just found the exact moment of failure and the exact values that changed. No logging framework. No observability platform. No $400/month SaaS bill. Just `git diff`.

**The deeper insight:** When state is versioned, debugging is time travel. You can rewind to any point, inspect everything, fast-forward through the failure frame by frame. The commit message is the event. The diff is the mutation. The log is the timeline.

This works because commits are cheap, diffs are efficient, and git already handles branching timelines. You're not abusing git — you're using it for exactly what it is: a content-addressable store with a built-in DAG of history.

**When to use this:** Any system with discrete time steps. Simulations. Game servers. Financial ledgers. IoT sensor streams. Anywhere state changes in ticks and you need to answer "what happened and when?"

**The trick nobody tells you:** Keep your state file small and diffable. JSON is good. Binary blobs are not. If `git diff` can show you what changed in human-readable form, you have a time machine. If it can't, you have an append-only blob store.

The next time a system fails, ask: "Can I rewind to before it broke?" If the answer is no, you're missing a commit.
